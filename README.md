# 🚗 **Levaggio Vehicle Service Management System**

Welcome to Levaggio, a robust Vehicle Service Management System developed to modernize and streamline the operations of Levaggio Car Service Station, located in Negombo, Sri Lanka. This project was created as part of our 3nd Year, 1st Semester IT Project Management (ITPM) module. Recognizing the inefficiencies of the station’s previous manual processes, our system introduces a comprehensive digital solution to manage appointments, service records, reminders, and customer interactions. With a focus on automation, efficiency, and user satisfaction, Levaggio significantly enhances the overall service experience for both staff and customers.
